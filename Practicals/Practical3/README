This directory is for the codes of the practicals conducted in week 3.
In the file labelled 'area_under_curve.c':
> We calculate the area under a curve f(x) using the Trapezoidal rule.
> The integral is replaced with a sum and area is calculated, later it is also calculated using the integral.
> We notice that the area calculated by sum and integral is equivalent.
> To run this file, we run the following commands in terminal:
        > gcc area_under_curve.c -o area_under_curve.out -lm (to compile the area_under_curve.c file, '-lm' maps math library used in the program to the gnu c compiler)
        > ./area_under_curve.out (to display the output after compilation)
