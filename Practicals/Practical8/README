This directory is for the codes of the practicals conducted in week 8.
In the file labelled 'gcd.c':
> We write a function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of positive integers passed as
arguments to the function.
> The GCD is calculated using iterative and recursive functions.
> To run this file, we run the following commands in terminal:
        > gcc gcd.c -o gcd.out -lm (to compile the gcd.c file)
        > ./gcd.out (to display the output after compilation)
