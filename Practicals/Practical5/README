This directory is for the codes of the practicals conducted in week 5.
In the file labelled 'fibonacci.c':
> We display the Fibonacci series upto number 'n', which is taken as an input from the user.
> To run this file, we run the following commands in terminal:
        > gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci.out -lm (to compile the fibonnaci.c file)
        > ./fibonacci.out (to display the output after compilation)

In the file labelled 'hyparctan.c':
> We calculate the Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent function using two methods, Maclaurin Series and natural logarithms.
> To run this file, we run the following commands in terminal:
        > gcc hyparctan.c -o hyparctan.out -lm (to compile the hyparctan.c file, '-lm' maps math library used in the program to the gn>
        > ./hyparctan.out (to display the output after compilation)
